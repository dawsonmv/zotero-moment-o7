# Project Cleanup Summary

## Cleanup Actions Completed

### 1. Removed Redundant Files
- Deleted migration-related documentation that is no longer needed:
  - `MIGRATION_PLAN.md`
  - `MIGRATION_GAPS.md`
  - `CRITICAL_GAPS_SOLUTION.md`
  - `ARCHIVE_TODAY_SETUP.md` (duplicate of cloudflare-worker/README.md)
- Removed temporary files:
  - `console_output.log/` directory
  - `zotero-moment-o7.xpi` (build artifact)
  - `cloudflare-worker/node_modules/`

### 2. Updated Documentation
- Updated `CLAUDE.md` to accurately reflect current architecture:
  - Corrected information about Archive.today support (now implemented via Cloudflare Worker)
  - Added documentation for new components (ArchiveTodayPusher.js, RobustLinkCreator.js)
  - Documented Robust Link HTML generation features

### 3. Improved Code Quality
- Fixed all ESLint warnings in bootstrap.js and zotero-moment-o7.js
- Added proper ESLint directives for Zotero lifecycle functions
- Ensured code follows Zotero 7 best practices

### 4. Updated .gitignore
- Added `cloudflare-worker/node_modules/` to prevent accidental commits

## Project Status

The project now:
- ✅ Follows Zotero 7 Bootstrap architecture best practices
- ✅ Has clean, consistent code that passes linting
- ✅ Contains only necessary files with no redundant documentation
- ✅ Has accurate documentation reflecting current functionality
- ✅ Includes full Archive.today support via Cloudflare Worker proxy
- ✅ Implements Robust Links functionality matching zotero-gusto-extension

## Next Steps (Optional)

1. Consider creating a `docs/` directory to organize multiple documentation files
2. Add `.editorconfig` for consistent formatting across different editors
3. Set up GitHub Actions for automated testing and building
4. Consider separating the Cloudflare Worker into its own repository
