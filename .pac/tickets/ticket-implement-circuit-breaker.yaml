spec:
  description: |
    Create a reusable CircuitBreaker utility class that monitors archive service
    calls and prevents cascading failures. The circuit breaker implements a
    three-state state machine (CLOSED → OPEN → HALF_OPEN) to automatically
    stop sending requests to failing services and recover when they're healthy.

  problem_statement: |
    Currently, when an archive service becomes unavailable (network issues, rate
    limiting, server errors), the plugin continues making requests to it, causing
    performance degradation and repeated failures. This wastes bandwidth and
    delays successful archives to alternate services. We need a mechanism to
    detect failures and automatically stop using the service until it recovers.

  acceptance_criteria:
    - "[x] CircuitBreaker class implements three-state machine (CLOSED/OPEN/HALF_OPEN)"
    - "[x] Tracks consecutive failures with configurable threshold (default: 5)"
    - "[x] Tracks success threshold for half-open state (default: 2)"
    - "[x] Auto-resets to HALF_OPEN after configurable timeout (default: 60s)"
    - "[x] Throws descriptive CircuitBreakerError when circuit is OPEN"
    - "[x] Emits state change events for monitoring/alerting"
    - "[x] Thread-safe for concurrent archive requests"
    - "[x] 95%+ code coverage with unit tests (Achieved: 96.66%)"
    - "[x] TypeScript types fully typed with JSDoc comments"
    - "[x] Code reviewed and approved"
    - "[x] Zero regression in existing tests (710 tests passing)"

  implementation_details:
    approach: "Create a generic CircuitBreaker<T> class with state machine logic: 1. CLOSED state (normal operation): Track consecutive failures, When failures >= threshold transition to OPEN, Reset failure count on success. 2. OPEN state (circuit open, reject calls): Reject all requests with CircuitBreakerError, After timeout transition to HALF_OPEN. 3. HALF_OPEN state (testing recovery): Allow limited requests to test if service recovered, If success count >= threshold return to CLOSED, On any failure return to OPEN with full timeout. Configuration options: failureThreshold (default 5), successThreshold (default 2), timeout (default 60000), resetTimeout (default 120000)"
    affected_files:
      - "src/utils/CircuitBreaker.ts (NEW - core implementation)"
      - "tests/utils/CircuitBreaker.test.ts (NEW - unit tests)"
      - "src/types/index.ts (UPDATE - export CircuitBreakerError)"
    dependencies:
      - library: "TypeScript"
        version: "^5.9"
        reason: "Type safety for generic class"
      - library: "Jest"
        version: "^30.0"
        reason: "Unit testing framework"

  testing_strategy: |
    Comprehensive unit tests covering:

    State Transitions:
    - CLOSED → OPEN when failures reach threshold
    - OPEN → HALF_OPEN after timeout
    - HALF_OPEN → CLOSED on success threshold
    - HALF_OPEN → OPEN on failure

    Failure Tracking:
    - Reset counter on success
    - Reset counter after timeout window
    - Don't count failures outside time window

    Success Tracking (HALF_OPEN):
    - Track successes separately in HALF_OPEN
    - Reset success count on transition

    Edge Cases:
    - Very rapid state changes
    - Concurrent requests during state transitions
    - Edge values for thresholds (1, very large numbers)
    - Error propagation with original error details

    Performance:
    - No memory leaks with timers
    - Cleanup on destruction
    - Minimal overhead for CLOSED state

  tasks:
    - "[x] Create CircuitBreaker base class with TypeScript generics"
    - "[x] Implement CLOSED → OPEN state transition logic"
    - "[x] Implement OPEN → HALF_OPEN timeout logic"
    - "[x] Implement HALF_OPEN → CLOSED/OPEN recovery logic"
    - "[x] Create CircuitBreakerError with detailed error info"
    - "[x] Add event emitter for state changes"
    - "[x] Write unit tests for all state transitions"
    - "[x] Write tests for edge cases and concurrency"
    - "[x] Add JSDoc comments with examples"
    - "[x] Run coverage report (target: 95%+) - Achieved: 96.66%"
    - "[x] Get code review approval"
    - "[x] Merge to main and push to remote"

  performance_considerations: |
    - Circuit breaker state checks should be O(1)
    - Use Set for tracking recent failures instead of array
    - Reuse timers instead of creating new ones
    - Minimize allocations in the critical path (per-request checks)

  security_considerations: |
    - Ensure error details don't leak sensitive information
    - Handle potential token/credential errors gracefully
    - Don't expose internal state to untrusted code
    - Rate limit error logging to prevent log spam

  documentation_required:
    - "[x] JSDoc comments with usage examples"
    - "[x] Example: How to wrap archive service calls"
    - "[x] Example: How to handle CircuitBreakerError"
    - "[x] Comment on why specific threshold defaults chosen"
    - "[x] CHANGELOG entry explaining feature"

  notes: |
    Similar patterns exist in:
    - Resilience4j (Java library) - good reference for state machine
    - AWS SDK - circuit breaker implementation
    - Node.js opossum package - inspiration for API

    Consider these patterns for future enhancements:
    - Exponential backoff for HALF_OPEN timeout
    - Slow request detection (timeouts that aren't failures)
    - Bulkhead pattern (limit concurrent requests)

  checklist:
    - "[x] Implementation complete"
    - "[x] Unit tests written and passing (710/710)"
    - "[x] Code review completed"
    - "[x] Coverage report shows 95%+ (96.66%)"
    - "[x] JSDoc comments complete"
    - "[x] CHANGELOG entry added"
    - "[x] Merged to main and pushed to remote"
