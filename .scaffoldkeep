# This file is a placeholder to document the .scaffold directory

The .scaffold/ directory is generated by the build process and contains:
- Build output directory structure
- Compiled plugin files
- The moment-o-7.xpi file (the compiled Zotero plugin)
- Update manifests (update.json, update-beta.json)

This directory is gitignored because it contains build artifacts, not source code.

To generate this directory, run:
  npm install      # Automatic (postinstall script)
  npm run build    # Manual rebuild

The postinstall script in package.json automatically runs the build
after npm install, so new developers don't need to manually build.
